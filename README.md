## About

This repository contains my tasks and solutions for the **Programming Fundamentals** course in the first semester of my **BS Computer Science** at **FAST University**.  

I am passionate about learning programming and always looking to improve my approach.  
If you have suggestions or better solutions, your feedback would be greatly appreciated!
