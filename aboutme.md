## About Me

Hi, I’m **Muneeb Uddin**, a first-semester student of **BS Computer Science** at **FAST University**.  

This repository contains my tasks and solutions for the **Programming Fundamentals** course.  
Along with programming, I also enjoy **read books** in my free time.  

I’m eager to improve my coding skills, so any suggestions or feedback are always welcome!
